## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud) from Kaggle.  

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model, run all cells in the Jupyter notebook ` Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb`:

1. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb
```

2. Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit app for interactive fraud detection, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
